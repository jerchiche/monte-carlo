# Monte Carlo
Project from my Masters degree from 2013

The project was to take a research article and understand it, then implement the explained method in C++

The article we studied was:
`Efficient Risk Estimation via Nested Sequential Simulation`
by Mark Broadie, Yiping Du and Ciamac C. Moallemi

I m not sure I have the right to put the article here so am not including it
